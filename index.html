                            <p>Being born in the year 1999 often feels like a blessing and a course. The so-called 90’s kids never see us as their contemporaries, yet we inhabited a similar environment and inherited much of their popular culture. One cannot blame them however for guarding their exclusive cool kids club, the 90’s were cool no doubt about that, and yet I almost find the first decade of the year 2000 more interesting. </p>
                            <p>The early 2000’s, 00’s whatever you want to call them, hold a special place in our hearts. The years before 2010 were marred by the turmoil of the ’07-’08 financial crisis in the United States. The once prosperous and unbothered middle class had suddenly found themselves the victims of massive corporate greed and an unending war on terror. Just as the 90’s saw grunge emerges out of an apparent boredom from the monotony of prosperity, acting out just to feel anything, the early 2000’s used art to handle the fallout. </p>
                            <p>This spirit can be clearly seen in the themes of garage rock music of the period. Albums such as The Stroke’s Is This It from 2001 embody the back to basics approach of the revival rock groups. Songs like New York City Cops clearly lay out the themes of resistance to authority and angst paired with a jangly punk sound. I love this album because you can almost imagine yourself in the garage jamming out this album. </p>
